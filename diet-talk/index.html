This pain originates in the spine but can radiate all the way down to the back of the leg, making simple things like walking or getting in and out of a chair an absolutely horrifying ordeal.</p><p>People who haven’t suffered from sciatica may think that <strong>I’m exaggerating,</strong> <strong>but I most certainly am not...</strong></p><p>Sciatica happens when a herniated disk or bone spur in the spine presses against a nerve, triggering a reaction that causes great pain, generally in one side of the body.</p><p>Symptoms of sciatica include pain in the back, buttocks, hip, or other lower extremities.</p><p>The pain can range from mild to severe and may be sharp and radiating. Some people with Sciatica experience leg numbness or pins and needles in the affected areas. Other common symptoms include burning sensations in the body and muscle weakness.</p><p>Left untreated, these symptoms can become worse and contribute to other conditions that bring on even more pain and discomfort.</p><h3 data-css="tve-u-1640762bf18"><em><strong>Who I am</strong></em></h3><p><em> </em></p></div><div class="thrv_wrapper thrv-columns"><div class="tcb-flex-row tcb-resized tcb--cols--2"><div class="tcb-flex-col" data-css="tve-u-164084737d6" style=""><div class="tcb-col tve_empty_dropzone"><div class="thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption" data-css="tve-u-1640842eee7" style="" data-float="1"><span class="tve_image_frame" style="width: 100%;"><img class="tve_image wp-image-88" alt="my author face" width="512" height="337" title="face.jpg" data-id="88" src="//healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face.jpg" style="width: 100%;" srcset="https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face.jpg 512w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-150x99.jpg 150w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-300x197.jpg 300w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-50x33.jpg 50w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-250x165.jpg 250w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-152x100.jpg 152w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-304x200.jpg 304w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-228x150.jpg 228w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></span></div></div></div><div class="tcb-flex-col" data-css="tve-u-164084737e0" style=""><div class="tcb-col tve_empty_dropzone"><div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element tve_empty_dropzone" data-css="tve-u-164082b035e"><p>My name is Alice Walston, and I’m a former long-term sufferer of Sciatica.</p><p>I’m 44 years old, and my troubles started in my late 30s, so you can get an idea of how long this issue bothered me.</p><p>As someone who works both in an office and on job sites for marketing events, <strong>I need to be healthy and stay on my feet.</strong> </p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element tve_empty_dropzone" data-css="tve-u-164082b035e"><p>Chronic pain is not an option as I want to be my best when I’m presenting, and I enjoy remaining healthy and getting in shape. <br><br>Today, I live in Santa Barbara, California where I enjoy hiking, surfing, and relaxing on our picturesque beachfront.

Hopefully I just need to rest tonight, and I’ll be back to normal!”</p><p>Boy was I wrong.</p><p>The pain continued to worsen over the following days, and walking, getting up, and even lying in bed became more and more difficult and uncomfortable. After several visits to the doctor, I finally had an x-ray and CAT scan performed, and the doctor gave me the bad news.</p><p>I had sciatica and the pain was coming as a result of a herniated disk. I couldn’t quite pinpoint when I may have experienced that, but it is possible that what I thought was just a pull at the gym was the cause of the herniated disk.</p><p>The doctor told me that I needed to rest and prescribed me some painkillers. The medicine certainly helped, but it made it nearly impossible for me to stay awake and it continually upset my stomach. The problem is that when I stopped taking the medicine, the pain became almost unbearable.</p><p>I was told to perform stretches every day and to remain mildly active but not to overdo it. As a gym nut, this was a major detriment to my lifestyle and really brought me down. Eventually, the pain started to subside, but then it would come back out of nowhere.</p><p>For years, my leg and back pain got the best of me, rendering me nearly unable to walk when they were at their worst. I became weak and out of shape, losing confidence in myself and constantly wondering if I could ever live a normal life. In the times when the pain was minimal, I would try to work out and it would only lead to worse, more intense pain.</p><p>I was <strong>completely lost, defeated,</strong> and had no idea what I could do to become the person that I was <strong>several years ago...</strong></p><p>My youngest child was only two years old, and I could barely even pick her up anymore thanks to all the pain in my back. My husband had to assist me in some of the simplest tasks, and I started to feel worthless and hopeless.</p><p>I couldn’t play with my children with the level I once had years ago, and I wasn’t able to go on the long hikes I so adored with my husband. Even swimming would cause me pain and discomfort, so I became, for the most part, inactive.</p><p>This devastated me emotionally. I thrived on going outdoors and enjoying physical activity, so this was a major blow to me.</p><p>I was unable to take on as many projects at work as many of them required you to be on your feet all day. That was never a problem for me in the past, but now that I was a sciatica sufferer, it was pretty much impossible. Even if I took 15-minute breaks throughout the day, the pain would be intolerable, and I would not be able to perform my job with a smile on my face. Having to sit in an office every day of my life for years was starting to wear on me and I wondered why this was happening to me.</p><p>Was there really nothing the doctors could do except to tell me I had to deal with the pain?</p><p>After several years of being fed up with multiple doctors, I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands. I was going to do all the research I needed and try every possible method available until I either found the cure for myself or encountered some sort of miracle that took my pain away.</p><p>For months I tried different herbs, medications, chiropractors, and meditation techniques. None of them really worked, although some had temporary beneficial effects. I became frustrated, but I continued to search for my solution. I was only 42 years old and there was no way I was going to let this miserable condition take another 3 years of my life away from me and my family. I was determined to be hiking, jumping, running, and surfing no matter what I had to do to get there.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, I finally found my answer.</p><h3 data-css="tve-u-16407615b34"><em><strong>How I found Sciatica SOS</strong></em></h3><p> I was experiencing one of my “good weeks” with my Sciatica, and I took a job at one of my company’s exhibitions in Los Angeles. Afterwards, I met with an old friend who had recently moved to Venice Beach. We hadn’t seen each other for years, so she was unaware that I was suffering from sciatica until I mentioned it to her over dinner. Immediately her eyes widened, and she grabbed my arm.</p><p><strong>“I know exactly what you need! My husband suffered from sciatica for years until he found this one amazing program that worked in less than a week!”</strong></p><p>Now, I had been trying everything, including things that came highly recommended by doctors and scientists, but nothing worked for me. So, forgive me if I was skeptical of my good friend here. While it was true that I was desperate for any solution and willing to try anything, I didn’t quite have a whole lot of confidence in her when she first told me.</p><p>“Well, I haven’t found anything that’s worked yet, but as long as it’s safe and legal, I’ll give it a shot,” I said.</p><p>We trekked over to her house after dinner and she brought me to her living room. On her tablet, she pulled up an eBook book that read “Sciatica SOS: Your Guide to Removing the Pain in 7 Days or Less – Guaranteed!”</p><p>Great, here I thought my friend had some sort of miracle drug or chiropractic cure that could fix me, but all she had was this lousy eBook. I was let down. She must have noticed my disappointment.</p><p>“Look, I know this probably isn’t what you were expecting. My husband didn’t trust it at first either, but after he finally got fed up enough with not being able to play softball, he picked up the book and gave it a shot. One week later he was free from all of his pain and two weeks later he back swinging the bat at his softball league! Trust me, this is going to work!”</p><p>I sat there for a minute and contemplated it. For almost a year I’d been trying experimental medications and physical treatments, and nothing ever got the job done. Sometimes I experienced temporary relief, but the fact remained that I was stuck with a chronic condition that showed no signs of going away. So, I decided what the heck? Why not give this a shot? If it didn’t work, I would just have to add it to the laundry list of other failed things that I tried.</p><p>But wow, this program worked.</p><h3 data-css="tve-u-16407643d46"><em><strong>How Sciatica SOS cured my Sciatica</strong></em></h3><p><em> </em></p><p>The Sciatica SOS eBook is a step by step guide that teaches you about lifestyle changes and habits you need to comply with in order to cure yourself of sciatica. One of the secrets is that it comes with an herbal tea that helps to relax all of your stressed muscles. This tea is based on a 2000-year-old Nepalese formula that the founder discovered on his own trip to cure his sciatica.  The tea is 100% natural and helps to provide pain relief as you go through the steps outlined in the book.</p><p>It should be noted that the tea isn’t the cure – it is merely a supplemental item that will assist you in your quest to free yourself of this painful condition. It will help to remove tense energies from muscles, tendons, nerves, and joints. This calming feeling will help you to be able to focus on the techniques and exercises needed to address the root cause of your sciatica and permanently relieve yourself of these aches and pains.</p><p>In combination with the tea, Sciatica SOS focuses on certain movements and exercises that you will need to do daily in order to help you re-align your nerves. At first I thought these are going to cause me great pain, but in the long run after carefully going through the program, they really work to get me in the proper alignment to combat all the sciatica  symptoms. You’ll also learn the best ways to sleep and even improve your posture and your gait in order to alleviate your pain. By day 7, you’ll feel like a whole new person as your back and leg pain quickly fades away and you start to regain the desire to engage in physical activities again.</p><p>This 100% natural approach to solving sciatica is an excellent choice for anybody who just can’t get past their back pain. If you’ve tried everything and still suffer from shooting, jolting pains throughout your body, you will be doing yourself a favor to pick up this book and start working towards improving your health. Stop relying on painkillers to relieve your symptoms and start enjoying life again! There are many benefits to be had from the book and the tea, and they certainly helped me as I have been back to normal for almost 2 years now!</p><p><em>Pros</em></p><ul class=""><li>All-natural cure</li><li>No medication required</li><li>No painful chiropractic or medical procedures</li><li>Guaranteed to work in one week or your money back</li><li>Quick relief of pain that leads to long-term eradication of your condition</li><li>Works across many sciatica patients, describing different exercises that can help with different types of sciatica</li><li>Self-massage techniques are soothing and relaxing</li><li>Promotes better overall health and posture</li><li>No doctors needed</li><li>Exercises are easy and beneficial</li><li>Restores energy levels</li><li>Increases confidence</li><li>Improves ability to engage in physical activities</li></ul><p><em>Cons</em></p><ul class=""><li>Only available in eBook format</li><li>Exercises require certain abilities and consistency that may be difficult for those with serious symptoms</li><li>Not medically proven</li></ul><h3 data-css="tve-u-1640766e9c4"><em><strong>Where to Buy Sciatica SOS - How I Got Mine for Cheap!</strong></em></h3></div><div class="thrv_wrapper thrv-columns"><div class="tcb-flex-row tcb--cols--1"><div class="tcb-flex-col"><div class="tcb-col tve_empty_dropzone"><div class="thrv_wrapper tve_image_caption" data-css="tve-u-16409b4a2ed"><span class="tve_image_frame" style="width: 100%;"><img class="tve_image wp-image-95" alt="product with bonus" width="660" height="411" title="bundle.jpg" data-id="95" src="//healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle.jpg" style="width: 100%;" srcset="https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle.jpg 660w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle-150x93.jpg 150w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle-300x187.jpg 300w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle-50x31.jpg 50w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle-250x156.jpg 250w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle-161x100.jpg 161w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle-321x200.jpg 321w,https://healthyspinejourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bundle-241x150.jpg 241w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></span></div><div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element tve_empty_dropzone" data-css="tve-u-164082b035e"><p><em> </em></p><p>After i gotten myself out from sciatica, i have been recommending it to my friends and colleagues!
